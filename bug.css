The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be issues if the units are inconsistent, or if the calculation results in an invalid value. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` is fine, but `calc(100% - 10rem)` might not work across different screen sizes effectively.  Another issue is forgetting spaces around operators in `calc()`.  Incorrect: `calc(100%-10px)`. Correct: `calc(100% - 10px)`
